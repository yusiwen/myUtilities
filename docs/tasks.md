# myUtilities Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the myUtilities project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Organization and Structure

1. [ ] Refactor the project to follow standard Go project layout (cmd/, pkg/, internal/, etc.)
2. [ ] Move version information to a dedicated package for better maintainability
3. [ ] Create separate packages for common utilities instead of embedding them in specific packages
4. [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
5. [ ] Remove commented-out code and TODOs, replacing them with actual implementations or GitHub issues

## Documentation

6. [ ] Add comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
7. [ ] Add godoc comments to all exported functions, types, and packages
8. [ ] Create usage examples for each command
9. [ ] Document the build process and release workflow
10. [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors

## Testing

11. [ ] Implement unit tests for all packages (current test coverage appears to be minimal or non-existent)
12. [ ] Add integration tests for the installer and mock packages
13. [ ] Set up CI to run tests automatically on pull requests
14. [ ] Implement benchmarks for performance-critical code
15. [ ] Add test mocks for external dependencies (GitHub API, search engines)

## Error Handling

16. [ ] Replace panic with proper error handling in installer/search.go
17. [ ] Standardize error messages and error types across the codebase
18. [ ] Implement structured logging instead of fmt.Printf and log.Println
19. [ ] Add context to errors for better debugging
20. [ ] Improve error reporting to users with more actionable messages

## Performance

21. [ ] Optimize GitHub API requests to reduce rate limiting issues
22. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
23. [ ] Use goroutines for concurrent operations where appropriate
24. [ ] Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
25. [ ] Optimize memory usage, especially when handling large files

## Security

26. [ ] Implement proper input validation for all user inputs
27. [ ] Sanitize file paths in the mock file server
28. [ ] Add HTTPS support to the mock file server
29. [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for the mock file server
30. [ ] Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## Feature Enhancements

31. [ ] Add Windows support for the installer (currently commented out as TODO)
32. [ ] Implement support for more package formats (deb, rpm, etc.)
33. [ ] Add progress reporting during installations
34. [ ] Implement a configuration file for persistent settings
35. [ ] Add more mock services beyond the file server

## Build and Deployment

36. [ ] Update the Makefile to support all target platforms
37. [ ] Implement semantic versioning
38. [ ] Automate the release process completely
39. [ ] Add containerization support (Docker)
40. [ ] Create installation packages for different package managers (apt, brew, etc.)

## User Experience

41. [ ] Improve command-line help messages and documentation
42. [ ] Add color and formatting to terminal output
43. [ ] Implement interactive mode for complex operations
44. [ ] Add command completion for shells
45. [ ] Create a web UI for the mock services
